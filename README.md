# LeetCode & CodeSignal Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various problems from LeetCode and CodeSignal. The solutions are divided into two sections: LeetCode and CodeSignal. Within each section, the solutions are further divided by programming language and difficulty level.

## LeetCode
All my LeetCode solutions are located in the `leetcode` directory. Within this directory, each solution is stored in its own subdirectory, named after the problem number and title. The subdirectories are organized by programming language, with subdirectories for each language.

Each solution is accompanied by a `README.md` file that explains the problem and provides a brief summary of my solution. The solution itself is stored in a file named `solution.{language_extension}`.

## CodeSignal
All my CodeSignal solutions are located in the `codesignal` directory. Within this directory, each solution is stored in its own subdirectory, named after the problem title. The subdirectories are organized by programming language, with subdirectories for each language.

Each solution is accompanied by a `README.md` file that explains the problem and provides a brief summary of my solution. The solution itself is stored in a file named `solution.{language_extension}`.
